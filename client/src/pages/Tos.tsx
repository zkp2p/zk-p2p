      <TermsSubheader>Last modified: December 19th, 2023</TermsSubheader>
      <TermsContent>
        <TermsContentSection>
          These Terms of Service (the "Agreement") explain the terms and conditions by which you may
          access and use the Products provided by us (referred to herein as "P2P Labs", "we", "our", or "us"). The
          Products shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, (a) zkp2p.xyz, a website-hosted
          user interface (the "Interface" or "App"). You must read this Agreement carefully as it governs
          your use of the Products. By accessing or using any of the Products, you signify that you have
          read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree,
          you are not authorized to access or use any of our Products and should not use our Products.
          To access or use any of our Products, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with
          us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g.,
          18 years old in the United States) and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and
          comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company
          or legal entity for which you may access or use the Interface. If you are entering into this
          Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent to us that you have the legal authority to bind
          such entity.
        </TermsContentSection>

        <TermsContentSection>
          You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions
          administered or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of
          prohibited or restricted parties (including but not limited to the list maintained by the Office of
          Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury) or (b) a citizen, resident, or
          organized in a jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide,
          territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the United States. Finally, you represent that
          your access and use of any of our Products will fully comply with all applicable laws and
          regulations, and that you will not access or use any of our Products to conduct, promote, or
          otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.
          NOTICE: This Agreement contains important information, including a binding arbitration
          provision and a class action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are
          resolved. Our Products are only available to you — and you should only access any of our
          Products — if you agree completely with these terms.
        </TermsContentSection>

          1. Our Products
        </TermsContentHeader>

        <TermsContentSubHeader>
          1.1 The Interface
        </TermsContentSubHeader>

        <TermsContentSection>
          The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of access to (a) a decentralized protocol
          on various public blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, that facilitates an escrow

          transaction between counterparties who engage in a transaction on peer to peer payment
          platforms (currently Venmo) in order to complete a trade for stable currencies on chain.
          The Interface is distinct from the Protocol and is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing
          the Protocol. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not transacting from us and
          that we do not control trade execution on the Protocol.
          To access the Interface, you must use a non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to
          interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is
          governed by the applicable terms of service. We do not have custody or control over the
          contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your
          wallet to our Interface, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms
          incorporated herein by reference.

          Agreement and by maintaining a current version of the Agreement. All modifications will be
          effective when they are posted, and your continued accessing or use of any of the Products will
          serve as confirmation of your acceptance of those modifications. If you do not agree with any
          modifications to this Agreement, you must immediately stop accessing and using all of our
          Products.

          5. DISCLAIMERS
        </TermsContentHeader>

        <TermsContentSubHeader>
          5.1 ASSUMPTION OF RISK -- GENERALLY
        </TermsContentSubHeader>

        <TermsContentSection>
          BY ACCESSING AND USING ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE
          FINANCIALLY AND TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE
          INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING CRYPTOGRAPHIC AND
          BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SYSTEMS, AND THAT YOU HAVE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF
          THE USAGE AND INTRICACIES OF DIGITAL ASSETS SUCH AS ETHER (ETH), SO-CALLED
          STABLECOINS, AND OTHER DIGITAL TOKENS SUCH AS THOSE FOLLOWING THE
          ETHEREUM TOKEN STANDARD (ERC-20).
          IN PARTICULAR, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE MARKETS FOR THESE DIGITAL ASSETS
          ARE NASCENT AND HIGHLY VOLATILE DUE TO RISK FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT
          LIMITED TO, ADOPTION, SPECULATION, TECHNOLOGY, SECURITY, AND REGULATION.
          YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ANYONE CAN CREATE A TOKEN, INCLUDING FAKE VERSIONS
          OF EXISTING TOKENS AND TOKENS THAT FALSELY CLAIM TO REPRESENT PROJECTS,
          AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT THE RISK THAT YOU MAY MISTAKENLY TRADE
          THOSE OR OTHER TOKENS. SO-CALLED STABLECOINS MAY NOT BE AS STABLE AS
          THEY PURPORT TO BE, MAY NOT BE FULLY OR ADEQUATELY COLLATERALIZED, AND
          MAY BE SUBJECT TO PANICS AND RUNS.
          FURTHER, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SMART CONTRACT TRANSACTIONS
          AUTOMATICALLY EXECUTE AND SETTLE, AND THAT BLOCKCHAIN-BASED
          TRANSACTIONS ARE IRREVERSIBLE WHEN CONFIRMED. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND
          ACCEPT THAT THE COST AND SPEED OF TRANSACTING WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC AND
          BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SYSTEMS SUCH AS ETHEREUM ARE VARIABLE AND MAY
          INCREASE DRAMATICALLY AT ANY TIME. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT
          THE RISK OF SELECTING TO TRADE IN EXPERT MODES, WHICH CAN EXPOSE YOU TO
          POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT PRICE SLIPPAGE AND HIGHER COSTS.
          FINALLY, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO NOT CREATE, OWN, OR OPERATE
          CROSS-CHAIN BRIDGES AND WE DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR
          WARRANTY ABOUT THE SAFETY OR SOUNDNESS OF ANY CROSS-CHAIN BRIDGE.
          IN SUMMARY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF
          THESE VARIABLES OR RISKS, DO NOT OWN OR CONTROL THE PROTOCOL, AND
          CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING LOSSES THAT YOU EXPERIENCE
          WHILE ACCESSING OR USING ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS. ACCORDINGLY, YOU
        </TermsContentSection>

          THAT ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE FREE FROM ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, OR
          OTHER HARMFUL ELEMENTS. NO ADVICE, INFORMATION, OR STATEMENT THAT WE
          MAKE SHOULD BE TREATED AS CREATING ANY WARRANTY CONCERNING ANY OF
          OUR PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY
          FOR ANY ADVERTISEMENTS, OFFERS, OR STATEMENTS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES
          CONCERNING ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS.
        </TermsContentSection>

        <TermsContentSection>
          SIMILARLY, THE PROTOCOL IS PROVIDED "AS IS", AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND WITHOUT
          WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. ALTHOUGH WE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INITIAL CODE FOR
          THE PROTOCOL, WE DO NOT PROVIDE, OWN, OR CONTROL THE PROTOCOL, WHICH IS
          RUN AUTONOMOUSLY WITHOUT ANY HEADCOUNT BY SMART CONTRACTS DEPLOYED
          ON VARIOUS BLOCKCHAINS. UPGRADES AND MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROTOCOL ARE

          ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR USE, INABILITY TO USE, OR YOUR INTERACTION WITH
          OTHER USERS OF, THE PROTOCOL, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
          SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSS OF
          PROFITS, CRYPTOCURRENCIES, TOKENS, OR ANYTHING ELSE OF VALUE. WE DO NOT
          ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ADVERTISEMENTS,
          OFFERS, OR STATEMENTS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES CONCERNING ANY OF OUR
          PRODUCTS.
        </TermsContentSection>

        <TermsContentSection>
          ANY PAYMENTS OR FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT YOU ENGAGE IN WILL BE
          PROCESSED VIA AUTOMATED SMART CONTRACTS. ONCE EXECUTED, WE HAVE NO
          CONTROL OVER THESE PAYMENTS OR TRANSACTIONS, NOR DO WE HAVE THE
          ABILITY TO REVERSE ANY PAYMENTS OR TRANSACTIONS.
        </TermsContentSection>

        <TermsContentSubHeader>
          5.3 NO INVESTMENT ADVICE
        </TermsContentSubHeader>

        <TermsContentSection>
          WE MAY PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT TOKENS IN OUR PRODUCTS SOURCED FROM
          THIRD-PARTY DATA PARTNERS THROUGH FEATURES SUCH AS RARITY SCORES,
          TOKEN EXPLORER OR TOKEN LISTS. WE MAY ALSO PROVIDE WARNING LABELS FOR
